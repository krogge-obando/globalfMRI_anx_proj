# Global effects in fMRI reveal brain markers of state and trait anxiety (Medirxn 2025)
Hello, this repo was created to provide the codes for conducting the analysis reported in the paper, ["Global effects in fMRI reveal brain markers of state and trait anxiety (Medirxn 2025)"]([https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.15.25331571v1#:~:text=Results%3A%20We%20observe%20that%20the,tied%20to%20the%20anxious%20experience.]

Here we share the following code that was used to derive the fMRI global components, and for some of the visulizations of the paper.
