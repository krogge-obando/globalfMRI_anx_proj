Conduct_Group_ICA

 - fix_ICA_40.sh : code that was used to generate a group ICA analysis with 40 components
 - ICA_fix_paths.R : code to derive the text file used as an input in fix_ICA_40.sh

Note: we used manual inspection to identify which components were networks vs noise, for more information to conduct a group ICA analysis can be found on FSL's website at (https://web.mit.edu/fsl_v5.0.10/fsl/doc/wiki/MELODIC.html).
