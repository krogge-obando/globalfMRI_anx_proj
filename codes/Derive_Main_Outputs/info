Derive_Main_Outputs code info

Obando_fMRIglobal_anx.m : a master code that derives the spatial and temporal data of our global fMRI components, conducts dual regression to derive network timeseries from our ICA components, functional connectivity pre and post global component regression on our networks of interest. Our code has comments to understand which sections derive certain components and below are functions we wrote needed to run the code. For questions feel free to contact me, my information is at the end of this repo.
create_hr_basis_dt.m : function code needed Obando_fMRIglobal_anx.m to derive the hr basis functions to model heart rate fluctuations in fMRI
regress_tc.m : function code needed Obando_fMRIglobal_anx.m to regress the global component form the networks time series
retrieve_fc_values: function code needed in Obando_fMRIglobal_anx.m to store functional connectivity measures after pre and post regression
Obando_derive_sd.m : code that derives the estimated drowsiness value (standard deviation of the fMRI arousal template), and the variation of the global mean signal.
Obando_lags_test.m : code that investigated if lags of global components significantly alter brain connectivity relationships to anxiety. (It did not)
generate_fmri_lags.m : function needed for Obando_lags_investigation.m that preforms lags of the global components
regress_tc_non_zscored.m: function that regresses the values similar to regress_tc but does not zscore the values in the function because they were previously zscored
